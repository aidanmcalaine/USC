================================ Questions ==================================

1. Which kind of a loop did you use for the first program? Why?

:I used a while loop because we don't know how many times the program will execute before it hits 1. 

2a. Once you've completed the second program, run hailstats on the following
inputs, and record your results in the table below:

  input range  | minimum length | achieved by | maximum length | achieved by
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    50 100     |                |             |                |             
   100 200     |                |             |                |             
   200 400     |                |             |                |             

2b. What pattern do you think there is in the values achieving minimum length?
Can you explain why it holds?

:

3a. Let X be the smallest integer whose length is greater than 150.
By running your hailstats program several times on carefully chosen inputs,
determine what is the value of X.

X is :

3b. Explain, briefly, the way in which you used your hailstats program
(i.e., which inputs you gave it) to find this answer.
