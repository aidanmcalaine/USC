================================ Questions ==================================

1. If only an 'int' type was used for the input, what is the maximum number
   of commas that would need to be added?
   
   We know that the max value for an int is 2,147,483,647. A maximum of 3 commas would be used. 

2. Did your implementation require a special case for the input of zero?
   If so, why?  

   Yes it does; while calculating the number of digits, I found it easier to write an algorithm that did not include 0, so I used a special case for 0 instead. 

3. Describe (succinctly) what was the most difficult part of the algorithm
   development for each part.

   I found it very difficult to extract the correct digit, because this is the first time I have done so from largest digit to smallest. 
   
4. If you did use the programming idioms linked
   on our website, did they help you?  If you did not use them, look them
   over briefly. Would they have helped in your opinion?
   
   I used the isolating digits idiom to pull out the correct digit.
